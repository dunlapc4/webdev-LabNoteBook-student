## Reflection Document

### Initial Thoughts

I was able to do some of the exercises on my own however using the lecture videos for the lab book
I feel helped me a little bit more. I believe this because I am more of a visual learner, and while I can google and struggle through things
I could also accomplish it in a way that is outside of the scope of this class, and / or learn the material through a less than accurate
lense. I am not sure what I should even put for the other specific categories below since I was not doing the reflections alongside the notebook
at the time so some of my thoughts and experiences on the subject is not fresh in my mind. I do feel like the videos do explain the topics well
and gives a good detailed visual teaching on the subject. I also like how you are able to pause, rewind and set to x times speed.

I will do my best to give my thoughts on each lab book session however I feel like it would be redundant to answer the questiom of "Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the video or solutions for help?" since I already stated it in the paragraph above.

### HTML

The First lab exercise on HTML was a good refresher to working with HTML while also providing more information about the subject
than I had originally learned.

### Accessibility

I really found the accessability exercises in this class very interesting and facinating. I deeply enjoyed learning what to look out for and what I could use
to look for accessability issues.

### CSS

This class is the first class where CSS was actually taught to me in a comprehensive way, this set of exercises helped me greatly since it demonstrated
a lot of different things that CSS could do. While it is from what I can assume, mostly surface material, it is still very interesting and makes
CSS less intimidating.

### Flexbox

Flexbox as a concept seems really interesting to me. Being able to dictate how things are displayed, in what order, and what position
is extremely handy and I am glad we covered it in this class.

### CSS-grid

This set of exercises was very interesting since its similar to flexbox in the sense it is a tool used to organize the contents on the page
in a particular way. It is just interesting that there are 2 separate tools that you can use but both have their own merits.

### bootstrap

Doing the bootstrap exercises I was excited for since it is a large framework that has multiple usages in the field.

### javascript

I have tried learning javascript before this class but I was glad that these exercises gave good hands on experience to using it in a web dev environment.

### j-query

I have heard my friends talk about using J-Query and when I used it it seemed very helpful for manipulating the DOM using javascript.
